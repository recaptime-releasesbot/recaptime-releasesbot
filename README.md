# Releases CI Bot at Recap Time Squad

My purpose is to automatically publish releases through the GitLab APIs for open-source projects the squad has maintained. Please do not add me to existing orgs and instead add me on per-repo basis.

GPG keys are still handled under the main bot account, @RecapTimeBot, on package repository signing for our GitLab Pages-hosted PPAs and Git tags.
